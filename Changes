Revision history for Perl extension Test::Compile.

0.02  Mi Okt  3 18:30:17 CEST 2007
    - made things cleaner by using UNIVERSAL::require on the suspected module
      name instead of do() on the file name, which introduced potential bugs by
      running at run time what would otherwise happen at compile time
    - bumped version numbers to '0.02'

0.01  Sa Sep 22 23:35:34 CEST 2007
    - original version
