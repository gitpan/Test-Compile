     - pm_file_ok() can now handle Windows paths (thanks clonezone).
     - fixed version number used in documentation (thanks JKUTEJ).

       the nail that sticks out gets hammered down.

0.08  Thu, 29 May 2008 12:08:32 -0000 (Marcel Gruenauer <marcel@cpan.org>)
     - set the version to 0.08
     - we now check for Devel::CheckOS with UNIVERSAL::require so we don't
       use() it so Devel::CheckOS won't be included when using Test::Compile as
       part of Module::Install::StandardTests
     - .shipit: fixed svk.tagpattern

     - no longer uses standard tests, since they require Test::Compile
       themselves. Instead, copied the standard tests's pod and pod coverage
       test files into this distribution. Thanks Andreas Koenig for catching
       that circular dependency.

0.04  Thu, 18 Oct 2007 10:09:39 +0200 (Marcel Gruenauer <marcel@cpan.org>)
     - fixed version requirement of Test::More

0.03  Wed, 03 Oct 2007 22:31:43 +0200 (Marcel Gruenauer <marcel@cpan.org>)
     - made things cleaner by using UNIVERSAL::require on the suspected module
     - The documentation now uses Test::More->builder->BAIL_OUT() in order to
       stop the testsuite from running if a compilation fails. Also, the
       documentation now urges that Test::Compile be mandatory (like
       Test::Exception often is) instead of optional (like Test::Pod often is).
       Thanks to Rob Kinyon for the suggestion.
     - bumped version numbers to '0.03'

0.02  Wed, 03 Oct 2007 18:30:17 +0200 (Marcel Gruenauer <marcel@cpan.org>)
     - made things cleaner by using UNIVERSAL::require on the suspected module
       name instead of do() on the file name, which introduced potential bugs
       by running at run time what would otherwise happen at compile time
     - bumped version numbers to '0.02'

0.01  Sat, 22 Sep 2007 23:35:34 +0200 (Marcel Gruenauer <marcel@cpan.org>)
     - original version
